Deep learning chatbot.

Install requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Additional**: With `nltk` you might need to install `punkt`:

Go to **Python shell** and type:

```sh
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```

The bots answers are based on `data.json`, which has different patterns.

I have included five tags `"greetings"`, `"goodbye"`, `"age"`, `"name"` and `"robot"`.

Be sure to test this out!
